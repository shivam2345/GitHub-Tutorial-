##Mad Libs Theater 

ELF: Hi Santa.

SANTA: Hello [Type of Dessert].

ELF: You’re looking at me like I’m on your naughty list.

SANTA: I was counting my toys and was one [Silly Word] short. I believe you stole it.

ELF: But [Another Word for Father]!

SANTA: I started making that toy in [Year]. What will little [Celebrity Name] think when he/she wakes up on Christmas morning with nothing under the [Type of Plant]?

ELF: I would never steal such a [Adjective] toy.

SANTA: Where were you the night before Christmas?

ELF: I was with [Something You’d Name a Pet]. We were listening to 
[Name of a Band]’s holiday album and making snow [Plural Animal].

SANTA: Then why did Rudolph see you [Verb Ending in -Ing] on the roof [Number] 
[Measurement of Time] before the toy went missing?

ELF: That’s a coincidence.

SANTA: The reason I work so hard, is because I get to spread joy to millions of people, and go sit by the fire shaking my [Body Part] while eating [Food] and drinking [Type of Drink].

ELF: Fine, I stole the toy. But I only did it because I wanted to impress  
[Celeberity].

SANTA: [One Syllable Noise], [One Syllable Noise], [One Syllable Noise] Every time there’s a holiday miracle, I sing my favorite Christmas song, Jingle [Plural Noun].
(singing)
Jingle [Plural Noun], Jingle [Plural Noun],
Jingle all the way.
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open [Mode of Transportation].

ELF: Merry [Holiday] Santa!
